//This will give an understanding of the project..

## ABOUT MAIN FILES:-
. index.js - server side setup file

>>public folder
. index.html - client side .js script is also there inside <script> tag..

>>src folder
. DB.js - establishes connection with database (will import that to index.js..)

>>model folder
. user.model.js - define schema for collection in database (in our case- schema must be same as in Hazree code)

>>router folder
. user.route.js - mention all routes for collection Users (will import user.model here.. )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HOW TO RUN?

. Open new terminal, run command " npm install ".. this command might take some time but let it finish
//this will install all required packages to your project

. In cmd of windows.. run command " mongod " to start mongo shell  //if you're using mongodb atlas - connection method will be different

*****
Now, before running.. you must have a Hazree database.. and in that database a collection called 'users'
Also data will only show.. if your 'users' collection has some data in it...
and plus.. if the schema of data matches your schema in file 'user.model.js'  
******

. While mongo shell is still running... open new terminal in vscode and run command " npm start "
